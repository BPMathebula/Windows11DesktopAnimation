# Windows 11 desktop switch animations
In windows 11, animations for switching between virtual desktops have been disabled, this can be bothersome because without the sliding desktop animations its hard to tell which desktop you're on. This small application fixes that by adding the animations back.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How it works
Windows 11 still supports slide animations when swiping on a touchscreen, we make use of this by sending touch inputs to the desktop that simulate a 4 finger swipe to left or right. This triggers the switch animation to respective left or right desktop.

# üóëÔ∏è How to uninstall app?
If you want to completely remove the program, just delete the .exe file.

# ‚è≤Ô∏è How to stop it from running automatically?
- Open task scheduler.
- Search for a task named "Windows 11 Virtual desktop animation" and click on "Disable".
